    If it's your first time using a calculator, all the buttons and options can be a bit scary. But whether you're using a standard calculator or scientific calculator, the basics are pretty much the same. Once you learn what the buttons do and how to use them for different calculations, you'll be more than comfortable using your calculator whenever you need it—inside or outside of school!
